Sorry about the delay. I had the test in my Drafts, and it didnâ€™t send.

Please keep track of how long it takes you to each.

BACK-END DEVELOPERS TEST

Dave is working on the frontend of a website that gathers lead submissions for visitors that clicked an ad on CatAficionado.com. Now he needs somewhere to send that information. Once a submission comes through, it should be validated and saved. Then the user should be subscribed to a Mailchimp campaign for future emails, and immediately shipped a calendar called "Cats of Colonial America."

Dave thinks the ad campaign could go viral, so the submission endpoint should be ready to handle lots of requests without bogging down or keeping website users waiting.

Explain the web service that you would create to support Dave's website. How would you handle each of the necessary features while ensuring that the solution is scalable and performant? Include any questions or concerns that you have for Dave, as well as any recommendations you might have beyond the initial scope.
